# surfs_up Challenge

## Overview

The purpose of the surfs_up challenge was to compare temperature observations for the months of June and December so that W. Avy could compare the data and make a decision that opening a surf and ice cream shop is a sustainable business year-round. 

In order to assist with this decision, we created a few queries that helped summarize some statistics for W. Avy that would give more insight to these months. 

## Results

* The average temperature for the month of December is 71, which is fairly warm and is only a little over 4 degrees colder than June's mean.
* The minimum temperature for the month of December is 56, which isn't exactly warm, yet is only 8 degrees colder than June.
* The maximum temperature for the month of December is 83, which is only 2 degrees colder than June.

## Summary

To summarize the results we found, December's temperature does not appear to be too far off from June's. Now December is certainly colder, but not by that much. We could see from the above tables that December is very similar to June for the mean, minimum, and maximum. Since the weather doesn't seem to be too different for December than it is June, I would suggest an ice-cream and surf-shop is an excellent year-round business idea.

Another query we could perform to assist us in analyzing this data is to check out the amount of precipitation for these months. Most people do not want to surf or eat ice cream in the rain, so knowing how much rainfall differs between these two could provide valuable information. 

Additionally I think another weather variable to include would be cloud coverage. Observing the amount of sunny days for both June and December would provide more information that could help us compare how similar June and December are.
